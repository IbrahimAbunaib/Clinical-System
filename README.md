for diagnostics you need to: 
Have Visual Studio installed, download the folder and open it on Visual Studio to test and run
Have localhost/phpMyAdmin, details are... servername: localhost; username = root; password: N/A; dbname: medical_diagnostics; 
When running the code by Visual Studio the login credentials for doctor are Username: doctor; Password: doctor123 
To login as patient you need to register first then log in back with the ID and password 
There are some data already stored in the database for patients check their ID if you want to log in as them the password is 123 
passwords can't be shown in the database because we set an encryption to the passwords in the database in the form of a privacy for patients' tests details
